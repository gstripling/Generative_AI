# Explore and Evaluate Models Using Model Garden

## Overview

You work for a real estate firm as a marketing analyst. Your company is intereseted in using Large Language Models to better help both home buyers and sellers who access their website seeking home mortgage information - (1) Mortgage calculations based upon current interest rates and (2) Brief text descriptions of homes they are interested in given their features. The realtors on your team are also interested in this information to better help them with pricing discussions with both buyers and sellers. You have been tasked to create prompts that can respond to mortgage calculations and to summarize text from very long home descriptions from your real estate site. Home descriptions are stored in a file in a Google Cloud storage bucket. 

You are not certain what tools exist on Google Cloud, but you know that you can explore Model Garden to explore available models for your use. Due to the time you have to implement a solution, you want to look for pre-built models that can be leveraged as much as possible. 

## Vertex AI

Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified artificial intelligence platform for managing machine learning and generative AI projects. Vertex AI Model Garden is a collection of pre-trained machine learning models and tools that are designed to simplify the process of building and deploying machine learning models. Model Garden is a convenient and easy-to-use platform that can help you get started with machine learning quickly and easily.

## Model Garden

Model Garden provides a single place to search, discover, and interact with a wide variety of models from Google and Google partners. These models cover a wide range of use cases, including computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data analysis. Model Garden also provides a variety of tools to help you use these models, including:
**Model cards**: Model cards provide detailed information about each model, including its accuracy, performance, and training data.
**Prompt design**: Prompt design allows you to interact with a model via a simple UI and tune the model with your own data.
**Deployment**: Model Garden can help you deploy your models to a production environment.

One of the availble models through Model Garden is the Natural Language API. The Cloud Natural Language API lets you extract entities from text, perform sentiment and syntactic analysis, and classify text into categories. In this lab, you explore Model Garden and how to use Generative AI studio to create and experiment with prompts for your use case. 

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:
* Explore Vertex AI Model Garden to find the appropriate model for your use case.
* Incorporate Model Garden in your machine learning workflow
* Navigate the Gen AI Studio user interface
* Create text, chat, and code generation prompts for the Generative AI lab use case
* Run Python code in a Jupyter Notebook that uses the PaLM API

  
## Setup and Requirements

![[/fragments/cloudshell]]

1. In the Google Cloud console, from the Navigation menu (![Navigation Menu Icon](images/nav-menu.png)), select __Vertex AI__ from the __Artificial Intelligence__ section. 

2. From the Vertex AI dashboard, click the __Enable all Recommended APIs__ button. 

![Enable all APIs](images/enable-apis.png)

## Task 1: Explore Model Garden

To view the list of available Vertex AI and open source foundation, tunable, and task-specific models, go to Model Garden.

1. From the Vertex AI dashboard, in the __Tools__ pane on the left, click __Model Garden__.

#### The model categories available in Model Garden are:
   ---
| Category | Description | 
|---|---|
| Foundation models | Pretrained multitask large models that can be tuned or customized for specific tasks using Generative AI Studio, Vertex AI API, and the Vertex AI SDK for Python. |
| Fine-tunable models | Models that you can fine-tune using a custom notebook or pipeline. |
|Task-specific solutions | Most of these prebuilt models are ready to use. Many can be customized using your own data. |
---

Here are examples of Model Cards. Pick a Model Card from each category and explore it. For example, you could explore the Label Detector Zero-shot foundation model, which classifies images based on labels, represented as a list of text prompt strings, which are provided by the user, and calculates the confidence score of each label√¢s presence in the image. You could use this model to input images of your housing inventory and classify a house based upon whether or not it was labeled as "close to shopping" or "not close to shopping". 

Or, you could explore the Task Sentiment analysis model, wihch inspects the given text and identifies the prevailing emotional opinion within the text, especially to determine a writer's attitude as positive, negative, or neutral. A use case could be the ability to identify customer complaints and provide timely support.
