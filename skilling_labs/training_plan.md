Here's a training plan designed to upskill your team in Generative AI, based on your team's skills profile. I've included key elements, but you'll need to fill in specific content and resources.

Training Plan Outline

1. Foundational Phase (For Everyone)

Objectives:

Demystify Generative AI (what it is, how it works, different types)
Explore applications for solar (company-specific examples are vital)
Basic prompt writing skills

Format - Interactive workshops led by in-house experts (if available) or external instructors. Supplement with short readings/videos. Hands-on activity: As a team, brainstorm potential use cases across different departments.

2. Targeted Upskilling: Tiered Approach

Based on the survey, create three skill tiers:

Tier 1: Basic Users (Most team members seem to fall here)
Objectives: Use existing Generative AI tools confidently, Evaluate AI-generated outputs
Refine prompts for better results

Format:
Tool-specific workshops (image generators, text tools, etc.)
Department-focused sessions (marketing gets different examples than QA)

Tier 2: Informed Practitioners
Objectives: Basic understanding of data for AI. Exploration of customizing pre-trained models

Format: Mix of workshops and online courses covering data literacy and AI ethics
Short projects to experiment with fine-tuning tools

Tier 3: Exploration & Development (Likely 1-2 people)
Objectives: Encourage innovation, not rigid skills prescription
Format: Mentorship/collaboration with more experienced AI colleagues (if possible)
Small-scale internal research project with clear goals

Motivation Matters: The survey reveals your team is enthusiastic! Leverage this energy with hands-on training sessions and examples tailored to their interests.
Pace & Agility: Divide the training into manageable chunks that correspond with the team's desired learning speed. This plan isn't set in stone â€“ adjust as you go.
Evaluation: Include short quizzes, project demos, or repeat the survey later to gauge progress and tailor the plan further.
																				
```

To get a more target training plan, I will type the following prompts individually until I arrive at table of skilling by actual role.

### Prompt(s)
```
Create the training plan by Role.
```

```
Create the training by First name.

```

Here is the link to the table.
https://gemini.google.com/corp/app/acbfda32607128e8



Part 2 of the Demo is live.

The next steps are to have the model -using prompt design - create the curriculum for one of the role/levels and actually design the course - e.g. it will put a response showing the slide, proposed image, and speaker notes.

After team training, the model can create a post-assessment survey. The model can analyze the results. 

As a final team-building exercise, have the team work together to create a simple sentiment analysis project that will capture customer sentiments using Generative AI.

### Prompt																				
```
Create the Generative AI curriculum for Cora, the QA Inspector.																			
```																				
Response: MY Link to prompt.

```	
Absolutely! Here's a draft Generative AI curriculum for Cora, the QA Inspector, incorporating her background and preferences.

Cora's Learning Profile

Current Skill Tier: Tier 1 (Basic User)
Desired Timeline: Within 6 months
Learning Preferences: External trainings, on-demand learning platforms


Curriculum Structure

Phase 1: Foundational & Applied (Months 1-3)

Foundational Knowledge: Participate in the company-wide intro workshops on Generative AI.

AI for Image Analysis: Enroll in a course like "Introduction to Computer Vision" or "AI for Defect Detection" (search Coursera, etc.). Practice with open-source image analysis tools using datasets relevant to solar panels, if possible.

Text Generation for Reports:Short course on "Natural Language Processing for Report Writing" or similar. Experiment with report generation tools, emphasizing the importance of human review initially.

Data Literacy Basics: Short online module on "Understanding Data for AI." Focus on image data and how it impacts tool performance.

Phase 2:  Consolidation & Exploration (Months 4-6)

Practice and Feedback:Integrate learned tools into Cora's workflow with manager support.Set regular check-ins to troubleshoot, evaluate output quality, and refine prompt writing.

Understanding Bias: Focused course or workshop on "Bias in AI", particularly as it applies to visual data.

Exploring Customization:
If Cymbal Solar has its own image datasets, investigate basic model fine-tuning with guided support (this might be an area for mentorship or external consultation).

Curriculum Considerations

Pacing: Adjust based on Cora's progress and how quickly these skills can be meaningfully integrated into her work.
Company Resources: Can existing image datasets be used for practice? Are there tech-savvy colleagues who can mentor her?
Evaluation: Include small projects or task simulations to gauge Cora's understanding beyond just course completion.

Let's Fine-Tune This!

Specific Courses: Would you like me to suggest course titles or providers that align with Cora's focus areas?
Project Ideas: Can we brainstorm a small-scale project she could work on in Phase 2 to apply her knowledge?
Mentorship: Does Cymbal Solar have anyone with moderate AI experience who could guide Cora, especially as she gets into customization?

Let me know how I can help tailor this curriculum further!

```	

### Prompt

```	
Develop a training plan for Generative AI upskilling for the following employees in the solar installation company: Tiko Greene =Project Manager, Technical Knowledge for Generative AI=1; Cora Whitley = Quality Insurance Inspector, Technical Knowledge for Generative AI=2; Matt King = Marketing Specialist, Technical 
```	

Response:

```	
Here's a tailored training plan for upskilling Tiko, Cora, and Matt in Generative AI, taking into account their existing technical knowledge and their roles within the solar installation company:

Overall Plan Considerations

Varied Skill Levels: Account for the differences in initial Generative AI familiarity. Start with foundational modules and then diverge for role-specific training.

Focus on Application: Emphasize how Generative AI can directly enhance their existing work processes and problem-solving in the solar installation industry.
```	
The model then presents a table, as shown here.
https://gemini.google.com/corp/app/aa1a7acccc4d110e


```	
Create the Generative AI curriculum for Cora, the QA Inspector.
```	

```	
Yes. Suggest a course title and using that title, create the course objectives, slides, image for slides, and speaker notes.
```	

```	
Expand the speaker notes to include more narrative.
```	

```	
Write more sentences of speaker notes for each slide. It is important that this is done.

```

```
Can you put this content into a table?
```

Table shown here in my profile
https://gemini.google.com/corp/app/acbfda32607128e8


We can then use the slides to begin to create a data repository for a slide content, that we'll be able to query by slide image, slide text, and slide speaker notes. There are many uses here - reduced maintenance when you'll need to update a specific reference and reduced development time for leveraging assets.

We'll write a prompt ask the model to help us begin to automate some things.

### Prompt

```
Write code to export this table into a .csv format, upload it to Google Cloud storage, and then import it into BigQuery. This will allow us to create a repository of our training content. 

```

Response:

```
Absolutely! Here's the code breakdown, including explanations for each step. Please note that you'll need to fill in placeholders for project IDs, bucket names, etc.

1. Python Libraries

You'll need the following libraries. If you don't have them, install them using pip install:

import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import storage
from google.cloud import bigquery

2. Create the Table as a DataFrame

# Create a list of dictionaries, each representing a slide
data = [
    {"Slide #": 1, "Slide Image": "Photo of a solar panel...", "Slide Text": "AI-Powered Image Analysis...", "Expanded Speaker Notes": "Intro, background, why important... "},
    # ... Add the remaining slide data as dictionary entries ...
]

# Create a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

3. Export to CSV

# Replace 'your_file.csv' with your desired filename
df.to_csv("your_file.csv", index=False) 

4. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Upload

# Authentication (replace placeholders)
client = storage.Client(project="your_project_id") 
bucket = client.get_bucket("your_gcs_bucket_name")

# Upload the CSV
blob = bucket.blob("training_content.csv")  # Adjust the destination filename if needed
blob.upload_from_filename("your_file.csv") 

5. Import to BigQuery

# BigQuery client and references (replace placeholders)
bq_client = bigquery.Client(project="your_project_id")
dataset_id = "your_dataset_id" 
table_id = "training_content"  # Name of the new table in BigQuery

job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig(
    source_format=bigquery.SourceFormat.CSV, skip_leading_rows=1, autodetect=True
)

# URI of the file in GCS
uri = "gs://your_gcs_bucket_name/training_content.csv" 

# Load the CSV into BigQuery
load_job = bq_client.load_table_from_uri(
    uri, dataset_id + "." + table_id, job_config=job_config
) 
load_job.result()  # Wait for the job to complete

# Success message
print("Loaded {} rows into {}:{}.".format(load_job.output_rows, dataset_id, table_id))

```

Note - You can use the same process to import the Skills Profile created by the model earlier into BigQuery. I'd recommend adding an employeed ID field for future use cases.

Now, back to Cora. It would be great to build a Chatbot based on her course. Let's ask the model.

### Prompt

```
Show me the code to create a chatbot to train Cora on the course you suggested. Use DialogFlow.
```

------------------------------------------------------------

TRAINING IS COMPLETED. TIME FOR POST-ASSESSMENT

```
Assume all team members have now had training on Generative AI as you have recommended.  Create a survey that captures open-ended questions. Put it into a table format. 
```

Response: 
Post Training Generative AI Feedback https://gemini.google.com/corp/app/aa1a7acccc4d110e

Have the team work together to create a simple chatbot and a simple app to capture Sentiment Analysis. Here is an example using customer feedback.
